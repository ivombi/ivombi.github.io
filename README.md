## About Me
Clive Humby, the British mathematician, in 2006 coined the phrase “data is the new oil”. This is only true  if keeping other factors fixed, companies are able to get the right tools into the hands of skilled data practitioners to gather, crunch, and extract valuable insights  so as to enhance timely data driven decisions. Getting the right data practitioner team who are skilled, innovative, creative, collaborative and above all passionate about data is one of the most challenging task for many campanies. <br>
I’m kubam Ivo Mbi, a Cameroonian by birth currently residing in Belgium with over  5+ years of working experience in data related fields such as database designer, developer and administrator, data analyst, helping campanies store, manage, extract and make sense out thier data. My successes have been backed by a rich and diverse educational background with degrees in data science, statistics, Health economics and  Biochemistry. Not leaving out key certifications such as Microsoft Certified Azure Data Scientist Associate and SAS Certified Specialist in Machine Learning Using SAS Viya 3.4.
