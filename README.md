## About Me
Ivo Kubam envisions a future where every zealous youth will benefit from a deserved lucrative opportunity in life. Aware that he might not live to see such a future, he is contributing to it today by unlocking lucrative AI and Data opportunities for both Tech founders and non-tech professionals through his company, Graffiland.

A Cameroonian residing in Belgium, Ivo's journey in data began in 2012 when he designed and developed tailored data management systems for hospitals and small businesses in his hometown of Bamenda, Cameroon. He has since acquired both academic and real-world experience, earning master's degrees from world-class universities and providing Data Science consultancy services to top companies such as Brussels Airport and Pfizer in Belgium.
